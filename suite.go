/*

Here is an example of Behavior as a Code suite for testing of Serverless,
Microservices and other systems that rely on interface syntaxes and its
behaviors. The behavior is implemented as function of the form:

  func TestAbc() assay.Arrow

where Abc is a unique name of test case. Each case declares cause-and-effect:

↣ "Given" specifies the communication context and the known state of the
expected behavior;

↣ "When" executes key actions about the interaction with remote component;

↣ "Then" observes output of remote component, validates its correctness and
outputs results.

assay.it evaluates suites and its functions sequentially one after another.
